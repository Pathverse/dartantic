# Project Brief: dartantic

## Core Requirements
1. Create a Dart library for easy data class and validation management
2. Mirror key functionality of Python's pydantic library
3. Implement source generation for clean, maintainable code
4. Provide built-in BLoC state management integration
5. Ensure type safety and validation at compile time

## Project Goals
1. Simplify data class creation and validation in Dart
2. Reduce boilerplate code through source generation
3. Provide a familiar API for Python developers
4. Integrate seamlessly with Flutter's BLoC pattern
5. Maintain high code quality and test coverage

## Success Criteria
1. Easy-to-use annotations for model and BLoC generation
2. Comprehensive validation system
3. Clean separation of generated and user code
4. Full test coverage
5. Clear documentation and examples
6. Active community engagement
